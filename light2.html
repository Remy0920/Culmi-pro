<h1>Functionality</h1>
<p>This system uses the built-in light sensor in a Microbit to detect outside light levels to dictate whether certain smaller systems/lights should be turned On/Off. It is meant to automate the job of having to turn ON or OFF certain systems at certain times of the day, like in the morning or at night before you go to sleep. When the Microbit detects that the light level outside has dropped below or risen above a certain point, the Microbit sends power the pin that is connected to chosen LED, turning in ON, while disconnecting the other pins, turning off any connected LED's. This allows for all of these parts to be automatically switched On/Off without any need for manual adjustment. (This prototype only uses LED bulbs, but it is possible to hook up many additional components to this system, such as fans, cameras, or any security measures.)  </p>
