  <h1>What does it solve?</h1>
<p>This system would solve the issue people may have of forgetting to turn ON/OFF any lights/systems in the morning or at night. This could include systems like front porch lights, nightlights for children, or morning alarms, and many of these lighting systems are important or benificial to the residents of the home. For example, the front porch light at the front of a house can act a security measure to deter possible burglars from trying to enter your home during the night, since having the front porch light turned on implies that the house is currently occupied. This would likely deter many criminals or burglars from trying to break into your home, as they would likely want to find a home that is unoccupied, so there is nobody there to get in their way.
